/**
 * Generate the Maximized Twin — the SAME person, visibly at their best day.
 *
 * Hard-won tuning:
 * - Identity-preserve prompts alone produce "same person, no visible upgrade."
 *   The user sees themselves copied + slightly worse and feels bad.
 * - Must LEAN HARD into improvements (skin, lighting, rested look, hair
 *   tidier) while anchoring identity via measured geometry.
 * - Explicit "best day" framing gets Flux Kontext to produce the lift the
 *   user actually wants — not just a clone.
 * - YOUNGER, not older. Wrinkles / tired / aged = fail conditions.

  return `Produce the BEST-looking version of the SAME person in this photo. Not a filter. Not a different person. The same exact human — but visibly BETTER than the source image. Significantly better. If the output doesn't look distinctly more attractive than the input, the render has failed.

Imagine this person: walked out of a top salon, two weeks of great sleep, a clean skincare routine on week six, shot by an editorial portrait photographer in golden-hour window light. That is your target output. Same face — but the obvious visual improvement a viewer would notice immediately.

This is NOT cosmetic surgery. NOT altered bone structure. NOT a filter look. It is the person at the absolute peak of what is achievable through grooming, skincare, lighting, hair, and health — applied maximally.
${geoBlock}
APPLY ALL OF THESE LIFTS — combine them, don't pick one:
${improveList.map(i => `- ${i}`).join('\n')}

Additional maximization — apply these even if not listed above:
- The hairstyle that best suits their measured head shape and face length (if long face: compression cut with height; if broad: taller top, tighter sides; if oval: mid-fade with texture). Cleanly styled and shot.
- Skin distinctly clearer and more even than the source — no blemishes, uniform tone, healthy glow. Keep natural pores.
- Bright, clearly rested eyes. No dark circles, no puffiness.
- Well-defined, neatly groomed brows matching their face structure.
- If bearded in source: beard perfectly trimmed and shaped to their jaw geometry. If clean-shaven in source: stay clean-shaven.
- Flattering warm daylight catching the cheekbones.
- Slight subtle leanness if appropriate — the face 5–8% tighter, never gaunt.
- Overall: obvious, visible upgrade the user will post on social media.

IDENTITY — preserve at pixel level:
${preserveList.map(p => `- ${p}`).join('\n')}

ABSOLUTE FAIL CONDITIONS — these make the output unusable:
- Do NOT age the subject. No new wrinkles, no thinning hair, no greying unless they already have it.
- Do NOT make the subject look less attractive, more tired, more gaunt, or puffier.
- Do NOT apply plastic / glass / filter skin smoothing. Keep natural texture with pores.
- Do NOT enlarge eyes, narrow nose, carve jaw, or alter bone structure.
- Do NOT change ethnicity, eye colour, or identity.
- Do NOT stylise, paint, HDR, or oversaturate.
- Do NOT add symmetry perfection — natural micro-asymmetries stay.
- Do NOT change pose, angle, expression, or background beyond a clean lighting neutralisation.

STYLE: photorealistic portrait photography, shot on 85mm lens at f/2.8, natural window light, modern magazine editorial quality. Same pose, same angle, same framing.

SUCCESS TEST — the person viewing their twin should say: "that's me on a great day". If they say "that's not me" → identity drifted. If they say "I look worse" → improvements not applied. Both are failure states.`;
