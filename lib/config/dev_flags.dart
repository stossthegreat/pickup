//  DEV FLAGS
//  Single source of truth for dev-only overrides. Flip these back before
//  shipping — every release build should compile with all flags false.
// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// When true:
///   · The app force-sets the local subscribed flag to true at launch, so
///     every in-app gate that reads LocalStoreService.isSubscribed() passes.
///   · The post-scan paywall gate skips straight to /report.
///   · The "Upgrade" chip in the home header is hidden.
///   · The "Upgrade" tile in settings is hidden.
///   · Onboarding ends on /home instead of /paywall.
///   · PaywallScreen, if opened manually, auto-routes back to /home.
///
/// **FLIP THIS TO FALSE BEFORE SHIPPING.**
///
/// v155 — flipped back to FALSE per bro: "add the lock for
/// subscription on it again the whole app as we previously planned."
///
/// v186 — flipped to TRUE per bro: "make it all free right now this
/// is testing." Everything Pro is unlocked across the whole app
/// while we shake the keyboard extension out + verify the new
/// funnels work end-to-end. Flip back to FALSE before the next
/// public TestFlight cycle that gates conversion.
///   · Free-tier scan, render, rizz, lines, chat, freeflow, lucien
///     gates all skip when this is true.
///   · LocalStoreService.setSubscribed(true) runs on app launch in
///     main.dart, so any code reading isSubscribed() returns true.
