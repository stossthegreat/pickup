/// WHAT YOU NEED TO DO BEFORE PAYMENT WORKS
/// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// 1. Log in to https://app.revenuecat.com
/// 2. Create a project "Mirrorly" if you haven't already.
/// 3. Project Settings → API Keys — copy:
///      - "Public SDK Key" for the iOS app  (starts with  appl_…)
///      - "Public SDK Key" for the Android app (starts with  goog_…)
///    Paste them into the two consts below.
/// 4. In RevenueCat: Products → Add each App Store / Play product by
///    the exact identifier strings in [PurchaseConfig.productIds].
/// 5. Entitlements → Create `pro` → attach both the monthly and the
///    annual subscription products to it. (The 20-credit pack does
///    NOT entitle `pro` — it's a consumable credit grant, handled
///    separately.)
/// 6. Offerings → Default Offering → attach all three products as
///    packages with identifiers that match the `packageId` values
///    in [PurchaseConfig.offering].
/// 7. Publish the offering. Rebuild the Flutter app.
///
/// Until keys are filled in the app still runs — the paywall just
/// shows "—" for prices and the CTA is disabled. No hardcoded prices
/// ever ship to the store.
