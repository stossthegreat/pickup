/// THE GAZE — Lucien's seductive-eye masterclass.
///
/// Twelve named eye MOVES taught the way a real seducer teaches: ONE
/// punch of WHY this move works on her, then a VIVID anatomy-named
/// HOW (her LEFT eye, your top lid, her top lip, slow, heavy, dead
/// brow). No CEO talk, no general "be confident" — every line names
/// the part of the face, the speed, the feeling. That's how a man
/// actually learns to look at a woman.
///
/// Flow per lesson:  WHY → HOW (vivid) → trigger → drill → correction
/// → drill (graded) → score.
///
/// Grounded in real research: ~3.2s is the most comfortable
/// mutual-gaze length (Binetti 2016); mutual gaze manufactures
/// closeness (Aron 1997); hard stare trips the threat circuit, soft
/// eyes read as warmth; the anxious man breaks down/away inside a
/// second, the confident man owns it.
