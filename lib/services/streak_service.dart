/// THE ASCENSION ENGINE — one source of truth for the three numbers the
/// whole app reconciles around: the daily STREAK (the flame), the
/// ASCENSION DAY (how far up the Observer → ImHim ladder you've climbed),
/// and the CONSISTENCY score (how fully you're doing each day's missions).
///
/// The model (locked with bro):
///
///   • STREAK — consecutive calendar days you showed up. "Showing up" =
///     completing AT LEAST ONE of the five daily missions. Do 1 of 5 and
///     the flame is safe; only a full ZERO-day breaks it. There is no
///     freeze/grace — miss a whole day and it resets. It is the same
///     number on every masthead (Looks / Rizz / Ascend).
///
///   • ASCENSION DAY — the TOTAL number of distinct days you've ever
///     shown up. It is earned, never free: it only climbs on days you do
///     the work, and it NEVER goes backward (a broken streak doesn't cost
///     you your day). Day thresholds drive the rank ladder (Observer 1,
///     Initiate 10, Contender 20, Dangerous 30, Magnetic 45, ImHim 60).
///     Clamped to 1..60 for display.
///
///   • CONSISTENCY — a rolling 7-day mission-completion rate. Each day
///     records how many of the 5 missions you finished; consistency is
///     the average of (done ÷ 5) over the last 7 days, ×100. Do all 5
///     daily and it climbs to 100; half-ass 3/5 and it settles ~60 —
///     the honest "you're only part-showing-up" signal. Missing missions
///     never breaks the streak, it just drags this down.
///
/// The five daily missions (mirrors the Ascend tab exactly):
///   1. PROTOCOL  — `looks_done_ymd` (scan / protocol check-in)
///   2. ROLEPLAY  — `game_done_ymd`
///   3. SCAN      — a scan captured today (derived from scan history)
///   4. PICKUP    — `pickup_line_done_ymd`
///   5. READ      — `rizz_done_ymd`
///
/// [refresh] returns just the `(streak, longest)` pair for the mastheads.
/// [progress] returns the full [AscensionSnapshot] the Ascend tab needs.
