      'photo bytes; it forwards them to the relevant AI provider '

      '1) The short audio clip you just recorded (PCM or compressed '

      'is closed; transcripts are not stored.\n'
      '• In flight: TLS 1.3 encrypted.\n'

      'speaker identification, advertising, profiling, AI model '
      'training, or resale.\n\n'
      'HOW TO STOP IT\n\n'
      'Skip the Eyes and Game tabs, or deny microphone permission '

      'tone.\n\n'
      'Even when CREATOR is ON, the underlying OpenAI policy '

      '1) The selfie photograph captured with the in-app scan camera.\n'
      '2) Sixteen scalar geometric measurements derived from that '
      'photograph, computed entirely on your device by Apple ML Kit '
      '(iOS) or Google ML Kit (Android). These measurements are plain '
      'numbers describing facial shape — canthal-tilt angle in '
      'degrees, jaw angle in degrees, face width-to-height ratio, '
      'facial symmetry score, facial-thirds proportions, eye spacing '
      'ratio, lip fullness, brow-to-eye gap, philtrum ratio, '
      'interpupillary ratio, nose length ratio, face length ratio, '

      'identify you.\n\n'

      'identity matching, authentication, ARKit Face ID, advertising, '

    const LegalSection('FACE DATA — QUICK SUMMARY',
      'IS FACE DATA RETAINED?\n'
      'No face image is retained anywhere. The selfie you take is held '
      'in device memory long enough to be analysed in a single API '
      'call, then dropped. Neither ImHim nor the third parties we '
      'send it to (OpenAI, Replicate) keep the photo, store a face '
      'template, or build a biometric record from it.\n\n'
      'WHY DO YOU SEND IT AT ALL?\n'
      'To produce the analysis. We send the selfie to OpenAI\'s vision '
      'model so it can return a written read of your face, and to '
      'Replicate so it can render a "maximised" preview based on your '
      'photo. Those two outputs are what the scan screen exists to '
      'show. There is no other use.\n\n'
      'HOW LONG IS IT STORED?\n'
      '• On the third-party servers: never persisted. Each request is '
      'one-shot inference; the photo bytes are dropped from memory '
      'when the response is returned. OpenAI and Replicate are '
      'configured to exclude these requests from any training corpus '
      'and from long-term retention.\n'
      '• On ImHim\'s own backend: never persisted. The backend acts '
      'as a transient router — bytes are forwarded in-memory only. '
      'Server logs record only timestamps and HTTP status codes and '
      'auto-expire after 30 days; no image bytes are logged.\n'
      '• On your phone: the scan image you took is kept on your '
      'device until you delete it via Settings → Delete all data, or '
      'uninstall the app. It never leaves your device after the '
      'initial analysis completes.\n\n'
      'WHICH THIRD PARTIES IS IT SHARED WITH AND WHY?\n'
      '• OpenAI, L.L.C. (San Francisco, CA, USA) — sent the selfie + '
      'the 16 on-device geometric measurements so its GPT-4o Vision '
      'model can produce the written analysis, the honest-looks '
      'score, and the chat / advisor replies.\n'
      '• Replicate, Inc. (San Francisco, CA, USA) — sent the selfie '
      'so its Nano Banana + face-swap models can render the '
      '"maximised" preview image you see at the top of the report.\n'
      'Both are sent over HTTPS / TLS 1.3. No other third party '
      'receives the image.\n\n'
      'DO THOSE THIRD PARTIES ALSO STORE THE FACE DATA?\n'
      'No. Per their published API privacy terms and our API '
      'configuration: OpenAI excludes our requests from training and '
      'long-term retention; Replicate excludes them from training '
      'and long-term retention. Each request is treated as a one-shot '
      'inference and the inputs are dropped at response time. Neither '
      'provider builds a face template or biometric record from the '
      'image we send.\n\n'
      'ON-DEVICE FACE MEASUREMENTS (MEDIAPIPE)\n'
      'The 16 geometric measurements (canthal tilt angle, jaw apex '
      'angle, FWHR, facial symmetry score, facial-thirds split, '
      'eye-spacing ratio, lip fullness, brow-to-eye gap, philtrum '
      'ratio, interpupillary-distance ratio, nose-length ratio, '
      'face-length ratio, head-shape category) are computed by '
      'Google MediaPipe ENTIRELY ON YOUR DEVICE. They are scalar '
      'numbers, not a biometric template. The eye-contact training '
      'in the Eyes tab (camera + face-mesh detection) is also '
      '100% on-device — no image bytes leave the phone during a '
      'live eye-contact lesson.\n\n'
      'BIOMETRIC / IDENTITY USE — EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED\n'
      'We do NOT use face data for: identity matching, facial '
      'recognition, biometric template building, advertising, '
      'profiling, AI training, or resale. Sole purpose is to produce '
      'the analysis on the scan screen.'),
